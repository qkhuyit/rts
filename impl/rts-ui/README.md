> Used Vue3.x family bucket, ant-design-vue4.x and typescript5.x to practice the new features and gameplay of vue3.x. I have to say that the Composition API of vue3.x is more flexible than the Options API of vue2.x There are many, which allow us to flexibly combine component logic. We can easily use hooks to replace the previous writing methods of mixins and so on. For more hooks, please refer to [vueuse](https://vueuse.org/functions.html)
